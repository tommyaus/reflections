By showing the differences between both files, we were able to
see what had changed in the new file, and detect the spelling
error causing the bug.

Having access to the history of a file can enable the programmer
to make changes from a certain point in time, if there is a bug
introduced. Also allows new prototypes to be worked on while still
having the stable release in use.

The pros of manually choosing when to commit is that the user has
full control over the process and can tailor it to suit their preferences.
However, user-error may be introduced if someone forgets to commit or if
they don't commit properly.

git log can be used to find all the logs of commits with their id's
git diff can then be used along with 2 commit id's found with git log
to see all the changes between the 2 files
Lines that have been added will be coloured green, lines that have been deleted
will be coloured red.

Using version control would make you more confident to make changes that could
break something because you can easily go back to a previous version if something
goes wrong.
