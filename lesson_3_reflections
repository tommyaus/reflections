You would want to use a remote repository over a local repository when multiple contributers are required.
It allows a group of contributors to see all commits and add changes where necessary.

You might want to only pull changes manually so you can choose what stays in your local repository.
You may not want everything that has been contributed to the remote repository to be updated in your
local repository.
