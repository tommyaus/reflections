Initialising a repository is required to be able to use git
version control with it. Git adds metadata to the directory 
to allow it to operate.

The staging area is different from the working area and the 
repository because it acts as an intermediate medium between 
the two. It allows us to add multiple files first then commit
them all at once later.
